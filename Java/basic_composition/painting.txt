//Examples of Artist construction
Artist anArtist;

//execute these one at a time
anArtist = new Artist(); //An artist we don’t know anything about
anArtist = new Artist("Banksy"); //Artist whose year of birth is unknown
anArtist = new Artist("Banksy", null); //Alternative Banksy construction
anArtist = new Artist("Van Gogh", "1853"); //A well-known artist

//The workspace automatically displays the result of calling the toString() method
//as you can see by executing the line of code below (unless you untick the 'Show Results' box)
anArtist.toString();

//Examples of Painting construction

//1. The Artist referenced by frida is used to initialise a Painting
Artist frida = new Artist("Frida Kahlo de Rivera","1907");

Painting p = new Painting("Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird", 
                          "1940", 4000000, frida);

//2. An anonymous Frida Artist object, used to initialise a painting
Painting p = new Painting("Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird", 
                          "1940", 4000000, new Artist("Frida Kahlo de Rivera","1907"));

//Another anonymous Artist object example. In this case we don't know the artist's year of birth
Painting p = new Painting("Stonehenge", "2007", 0, new Artist("Banksy"));

//3. A painting created without an artist having been provided
Painting p = new Painting("An Enormous Sheep"); //inspect the artist inside p

//The artist for p could be set at a later stage as follows:
p.setArtistName("Sheepy Parva"); //inspect p's artist again to see what happened
